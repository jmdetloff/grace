Grace
=====

Grace is a demo I built while trying to learn a bit about using Box2d and experiment with 2d platformer controls on a touch interface. I built out a few areas, sensors, animations, and set up the physics of Grace's world to rotate with the user's movement. A video demo can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCPVFmGjffA
